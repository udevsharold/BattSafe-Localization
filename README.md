# BattSafe-Localization
 
To localize it in your locale, duplicate en.lproj folder and rename it according to your locale's ISO code.
More info on locale ISO code: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPInternational/LanguageandLocaleIDs/LanguageandLocaleIDs.html

Change the string accordingly in Localizable.strings files. For example, localization in Spanish (es.lproj):

"DEVELOPMENT" = "Desarrollo";
